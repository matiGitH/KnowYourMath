# Knowyourmath

Knowyourmath is a web application designed to help independent and curious students improve their math skills across various topics. It evaluates the user's knowledge through adaptive exercises that adjust to their current level and then identifies what concepts they have mastered and which ones need reinforcement. 
Based on the results, the platform recommends a curated list of study materials tailored the user's weak points. It is specially suited for self-taught students like myself, offering a complete and guided experience: helping users locate where they stand and clearly showing what steps come next.
